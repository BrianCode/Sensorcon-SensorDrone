/**
 * Provides the SensorSimulator in form of a Java Applet to be run in a web browser.
 * 
 * The applet can be used in a HTML document in the following way:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;applet code="org.openintents.tools.sensorsimulator.SensorSimulatorWeb.class" 
 *         archive="sensorsimulator.jar" width="640" height="440" alt="OpenIntents"&gt;
 * &lt;/applet&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The applet currently does not take any parameters.
 * 
 * Note that the applet is meant as a demo only. Due to web browser restrictions,
 * an Android application running in the emulator is not allowed to connect
 * to a Java applet.
